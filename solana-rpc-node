Hardware Recommendations

CPU
12 cores / 24 threads, or more
2.8GHz base clock speed, or faster
SHA extensions instruction support
AMD Gen 3 or newer
Intel Ice Lake or newer
AVX2 instruction support (to use official release binaries, self-compile otherwise)
Support for AVX512f is helpful

RAM
256GB or more
Error Correction Code (ECC) memory is suggested
Motherboard with 512GB capacity suggested

Disk
PCIe Gen3 x4 NVME SSD, or better
Accounts: 500GB, or larger. High TBW (Total Bytes Written)
Ledger: 1TB or larger. High TBW suggested
OS: (Optional) 500GB, or larger. SATA OK
The OS may be installed on the ledger disk, though testing has shown better performance with the ledger on its own disk
Accounts and ledger can be stored on the same disk, however due to high IOPS, this is not recommended
The Samsung 970 and 980 Pro series SSDs are popular with the validator community

GPUs
Not necessary at this time
Operators in the validator community do no use GPUs currently


RPC Node Recommendations
The hardware recommendations above should be considered bare minimums if the validator is intended to be employed as an RPC node. To provide full functionality and improved reliability, the following adjustments should be made.

CPU
16 cores / 32 threads, or more

RAM
512 GB or more if account-index is used

Disk
Consider a larger ledger disk if longer transaction history is required
Accounts and ledger should not be stored on the same disk
